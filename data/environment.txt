Human impact on  environment
Human impact on  environment or anthropogenic impact on  environment includes changes to
biophysical environments[1]  ecosystems, biodiversity,  natural resources[2][3] caused directly or
indirectly by humans, including global warming,[1][4] environmental degradation[1] (such as ocean
acidification[1][5]), mass extinction  biodiversity loss,[6][7][8][9] ecological crisis,  ecological collapse.
Modifying  environment to fit  needs of society is causing severe effects, which become worse as 
problem of human overpopulation continues.[10][11] Some human activities that cause damage (eir
directly or indirectly) to  environment on a global scale include human reproduction,[12]
overconsumption, overexploitation, pollution,  deforestation, to name but a few. Some of  problems,
including global warming  biodiversity loss pose an existential risk to  human race,[13][14]  human
overpopulation causes those problems.[15][16][17]

 term anthropogenic designates an effect or object resulting from human activity.  term was first
used in  technical sense by Russian geologist Alexey Pavlov,  it was first used in English by British
ecologist Arthur Tansley in reference to human influences on climax plant communities.[18] 
atmospheric scientist Paul Crutzen introduced  term "Anthropocene" in  mid-1970s.[19]  term is
sometimes used in  context of pollution emissions that are produced from human activity since  start
of  Agricultural Revolution but also applies broadly to all major human impacts on  environment.[20]
Many of  actions taken by humans that contribute to a heated environment stem from  burning of
fossil fuel from a variety of sources, such as: electricity, cars, planes, space heating, manufacturing, or 
destruction of forests.[21]

Human overpopulation
David Attenborough described  level of human population on  planet as a multiplier of all or
environmental problems.[23] In 2013, he described humanity as "a plague on  Earth" that needs to be
controlled by limiting population growth.[24]

Some deep ecologists, such as  radical thinker  polemicist Pentti Linkola, see human overpopulation
as a threat to  entire biosphere.[25] In 2017, over 15,000 scientists around  world issued a second
warning to humanity which asserted that rapid human population growth is  "primary driver behind many
ecological  even societal threats."[26]


Human overconsumption
Overconsumption is a situation where resource use has
outpaced  sustainable capacity of  ecosystem. It
can be measured by  ecological footprint, a
resource accounting approach which compares human
dem on ecosystems with  amount of planet
matter ecosystems can renew. Estimates indicate that
humanity's current dem is 70%[28] higher than 
regeneration rate of all of  planet's ecosystems
combined. A prolonged pattern of overconsumption
leads to environmental degradation   eventual
loss of resource bases.
                                                             Human population from 10000 BCE to 2000 CE, with

many factors, not just  raw number of people. ir
lifestyle (including overall affluence  resource
utilization)   pollution y generate (including
carbon footprint) are equally important. In 2008,  New
York Times stated that  inhabitants of  developed
nations of  world consume resources like oil  metals
at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of 
developing world, who make up  majority of  human
population.[29]

 effects of overpopulation are compounded by
overconsumption. According to Paul R. Ehrlich, speaking           Chart published by NASA depicting CO2 levels

chickens are triple  weight of all  wild birds, while domesticated cattle  pigs outweigh all wild
mammals by 14 to 1.[32][33] Global meat consumption is projected to more than double by 2050, perhaps as
much as 76%, as  global population rises to more than 9 billion, which will be a significant driver of
furr biodiversity loss  increased GHG emissions.[34][35]


Fishing  farming
 environmental impact of agriculture varies based on  wide variety of agricultural practices employed
around  world. Ultimately,  environmental impact depends on  production practices of  system
used by farmers.  connection between emissions into  environment   farming system is indirect,
as it also depends on or climate variables such as rainfall  temperature.

re are two types of indicators of environmental impact: "means-
based", which is based on  farmer's production methods, 
"effect-based", which is  impact that farming methods have on 
farming system or on emissions to  environment. An example of a
means-based indicator would be  quality of groundwater that is
affected by  amount of nitrogen applied to  soil. An indicator
reflecting  loss of nitrate to groundwater would be effect-
based.[36]

 environmental impact of agriculture involves a variety of factors
                                                                            Lacanja burn
from  soil, to water,  air, animal  soil diversity, plants, 
 food itself. Some of  environmental issues that are related to
agriculture are climate change, deforestation, genetic engineering,
irrigation problems, pollutants, soil degradation,  waste.


Fishing

 environmental impact of fishing can be divided
into issues that involve  availability of fish to be
caught, such as overfishing, sustainable fisheries, 
fisheries management;  issues that involve 
impact of fishing on or elements of 
environment, such as by-catch  destruction of
habitat such as coral reefs.[37]

se conservation issues are part of marine
conservation,  are addressed in fisheries science
programs. re is a growing gap between how many
fish are available to be caught  humanity's desire to      Fishing down  foodweb
catch m, a problem that gets worse as  world
population grows.

Similar to or environmental issues, re can be conflict between  fishermen who depend on fishing
for ir livelihoods  fishery scientists who realize that if future fish populations are to be sustainable
n some fisheries must reduce or even close.[38]

 journal Science published a four-year study in November 2006, which predicted that, at prevailing
trends,  world would run out of wild-caught seafood in 2048.  scientists stated that  decline was a
result of overfishing, pollution  or environmental factors that were reducing  population of
fisheries at  same time as ir ecosystems were being degraded. Yet again  analysis has met criticism
as being fundamentally flawed,  many fishery management officials, industry representatives 
scientists challenge  findings, although  debate continues. Many countries, such as Tonga,  United
States, Australia  New Zeal,  international management bodies have taken steps to appropriately
manage marine resources.[39][40]

 UN's Food  Agriculture Organization (FAO) released ir biennial State of World Fisheries 
Aquaculture in 2018[41] noting that capture fishery production has remained constant for  last two
decades but unsustainable overfishing has increased to 33% of  world's fisheries. y also noted that
aquaculture,  production of farmed fish, has increased from 120 million tonnes per year in 1990 to over
170 million tonnes in 2018.[42]


Irrigation

 environmental impact of irrigation includes
 changes in quantity  quality of soil 
water as a result of irrigation   ensuing
effects on natural  social conditions at 
tail-end  downstream of  irrigation
scheme.

 impacts stem from  changed
hydrological conditions owing to  installation
 operation of  scheme.

An irrigation scheme often draws water from  river  distributes it over  irrigated area. As a
hydrological result it is found that:

     downstream river discharge is reduced
     evaporation in  scheme is increased
     groundwater recharge in  scheme is increased
     level of  water table rises
     drainage flow is increased.

se may be called direct effects.

Effects on soil  water quality are indirect  complex,  subsequent impacts on natural, ecological
 socio-economic conditions are intricate. In some, but not all instances, water logging  soil
salinization can result. However, irrigation can also be used, toger with soil drainage, to overcome soil
salinization by leaching excess salts from  vicinity of  root zone.[43][44]

Irrigation can also be done extracting groundwater by (tube)wells. As a hydrological result it is found that
 level of  water descends.  effects may be water mining, l/soil subsidence, , along  coast,
saltwater intrusion.

Irrigation projects can have large benefits, but  negative side effects are often overlooked.[45][46]
Agricultural irrigation technologies such as high powered water pumps, dams,  pipelines are responsible
for  large-scale depletion of fresh water resources such as aquifers, lakes,  rivers. As a result of this
massive diversion of freshwater, lakes, rivers,  creeks are running dry, severely altering or stressing
surrounding ecosystems,  contributing to  extinction of many aquatic species.[47]


Agricultural l loss
Lal  Stewart estimated global loss of agricultural l by
degradation  abonment at 12 million hectares per year.[48] In
contrast, according to Scherr, GLASOD (Global Assessment of
Human-Induced Soil Degradation, under  UN Environment
Programme) estimated that 6 million hectares of agricultural l
per year had been lost to soil degradation since  mid-1940s, 
she noted that this magnitude is similar to earlier estimates by Dudal
 by Rozanov et al.[49] Such losses are attributable not only to soil
erosion, but also to salinization, loss of nutrients  organic matter,   Urban sprawl in California
acidification, compaction, water logging  subsidence.[50] Human-
induced l degradation tends to be particularly serious in dry
regions. Focusing on soil properties, Oldeman estimated that about
19 million square kilometers of global l area had been degraded;
Dregne  Chou, who included degradation of vegetation cover as
well as soil, estimated about 36 million square kilometers degraded
in  world's dry regions.[51] Despite estimated losses of
agricultural l,  amount of arable l used in crop production
globally increased by about 9% from 1961 to 2012,  is estimated
to have been 1.396 billion hectares in 2012.[52]
                                                                           Soil erosion in Madagascar
Global average soil erosion rates are thought to be high,  erosion
rates on conventional cropl generally exceed estimates of soil
production rates, usually by more than an order of magnitude.[53] In  US, sampling for erosion estimates
by  US NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service) is statistically based,  estimation uses 
Universal Soil Loss Equation  Wind Erosion Equation. For 2010, annual average soil loss by sheet, rill
 wind erosion on non-federal US l was estimated to be 10.7 t/ha on cropl  1.9 t/ha on pasture
l;  average soil erosion rate on US cropl had been reduced by about 34% since 1982.[54] No-till
 low-till practices have become increasingly common on North American cropl used for production
of grains such as wheat  barley. On uncultivated cropl,  recent average total soil loss has been 2.2
t/ha per year.[54] In comparison with agriculture using conventional cultivation, it has been suggested that,
because no-till agriculture produces erosion rates much closer to soil production rates, it could provide a
foundation for sustainable agriculture.[53]

L degradation is a process in which  value of  biophysical environment is affected by a
combination of human-induced processes acting upon  l.[55] It is viewed as any change or disturbance
to  l perceived to be deleterious or undesirable.[56] Natural hazards are excluded as a cause; however
human activities can indirectly affect phenomena such as floods  bush fires. This is considered to be an
important topic of  21st century due to  implications l degradation has upon agronomic
productivity,  environment,  its effects on food security.[57] It is estimated that up to 40% of 
world's agricultural l is seriously degraded.[58]


Meat production

Environmental impacts associated with meat production include use of fossil energy, water  l
resources, greenhouse gas emissions,  in some instances, rainforest clearing, water pollution  species
endangerment, among or adverse effects.[61][62] Steinfeld et al. of  FAO estimated that 18% of global
anthropogenic GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions (estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents) are
associated in some way with livestock production.[61] FAO data indicate that meat accounted for 26% of
global livestock product tonnage in 2011.[63]
Globally, enteric fermentation (mostly in ruminant livestock)
accounts for about 27% of anthropogenic methane emissions,[64]
Despite methane's 100-year global warming potential, recently
estimated at 28 without  34 with climate carbon feedbacks,[64]
methane emission is currently contributing relatively little to global
warming. Although reduction of methane emissions would have a
rapid effect on warming,  expected effect would be small.[65]
Or anthropogenic GHG emissions associated with livestock
production include carbon dioxide from fossil fuel consumption
(mostly for production, harvesting  transport of feed),  nitrous      Worldwide,  animal industry

identified.[66][67][68][69][70]

Considerable water use is associated with meat production, mostly
because of water used in production of vegetation that provides feed.
re are several published estimates of water use associated with
livestock  meat production, but  amount of water use assignable
to such production is seldom estimated. For example, “green water” use
is evapotranspirational use of soil water that has been provided directly
by precipitation;  “green water” has been estimated to account for
94% of global beef cattle production's “water footprint”,[71]  on
rangel, as much as 99.5% of  water use associated with beef
production is “green water”.

Impairment of water quality by manure  or substances in runoff
 infiltrating water is a concern, especially where intensive livestock      Biomass of mammals on

Changes in livestock production practices influence 
environmental impact of meat production, as illustrated by some
beef data. In  US beef production system, practices prevailing in
2007 are estimated to have involved 8.6% less fossil fuel use, 16%
less greenhouse gas emissions (estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide
equivalents), 12% less withdrawn water use  33% less l use,
per unit mass of beef produced, than in 1977.[74] From 1980 to 2012
in  US, while population increased by 38%,  small ruminant
inventory decreased by 42%,  cattle--calves inventory
decreased by 17%,  methane emissions from livestock decreased            A village palm oil press "malaxeur" in

production increased over that period.[75]
Some impacts of meat-producing livestock may be considered environmentally beneficial. se include
waste reduction by conversion of human-inedible crop residues to food, use of livestock as an alternative to
herbicides for control of invasive  noxious weeds  or vegetation management,[76] use of animal
manure as fertilizer as a substitute for those syntic fertilizers that require considerable fossil fuel use for
manufacture, grazing use for wildlife habitat enhancement,[77]  carbon sequestration in response to
grazing practices,[78][79] among ors. Conversely, according to some studies appearing in peer-reviewed
journals,  growing dem for meat is contributing to significant biodiversity loss as it is a significant
driver of deforestation  habitat destruction.[80][81][82][35] Moreover,  2019 Global Assessment Report
on Biodiversity  Ecosystem Services by IPBES also warns that ever increasing l use for meat
production plays a significant role in biodiversity loss.[83][84] A 2006 Food  Agriculture Organization
report, Livestock's Long Shadow, found that around 26% of  planet's terrestrial surface is devoted to
livestock grazing.[85]

Ecosystem impacts

Environmental degradation

Human activity is causing environmental degradation, which is 
deterioration of  environment through depletion of resources such as air,
water  soil;  destruction of ecosystems; habitat destruction; 
extinction of wildlife;  pollution. It is defined as any change or
disturbance to  environment perceived to be deleterious or
undesirable.[56] As indicated by  I=PAT equation, environmental impact
(I) or degradation is caused by  combination of an already very large 
increasing human population (P), continually increasing economic growth or
per capita affluence (A),   application of resource-depleting 
polluting technology (T).[86][87]


Habitat Fragmentation
                                                                                     Child demonstrating for
According to a 2018 study in Nature, 87% of  oceans  77% of l               actions to protect 
(excluding Antarctica) have been altered by anthropogenic activity,  23%          environment (2018)
of  planet's lmass remains as wilderness.[88]

Habitat fragmentation is  reduction of large tracts of habitat leading to habitat loss. Habitat fragmentation
 loss are considered as being  main cause of  loss of biodiversity  degradation of  ecosystem
all over  world. Human actions are greatly responsible for habitat fragmentation,  loss as se actions
alter  connectivity  quality of habitats. Understing  consequences of habitat fragmentation is
important for  preservation of biodiversity  enhancing  functioning of  ecosystem.[89]

Both agricultural plants  animals depend on pollination for reproduction. Vegetables  fruits are an
important diet for human beings  depend on pollination. Whenever re is habitat destruction,
pollination is reduced  crop yield as well. Many pants also rely on animals  most especially those that
eat fruit for seed dispersal. refore,  destruction of habitat for animal severely affects all  plant
species that depend on m.[90]
Mass extinction

Biodiversity generally refers to  variety  variability of life on Earth,  is represented by  number
of different species re are on  planet. Since its introduction, Homo sapiens ( human species) has
been killing off entire species eir directly (such as through hunting) or indirectly (such as by destroying
habitats), causing  extinction of species at an alarming rate. Humans are  cause of  current mass
extinction, called  Holocene extinction, driving extinctions to 100 to 1000 times  normal background
rate.[91][92] Though most experts agree that human beings have accelerated  rate of species extinction,
some scholars have postulated without humans,  biodiversity of  Earth would grow at an exponential
rate rar than decline.[2]  Holocene extinction continues, with meat consumption, overfishing, ocean
acidification   amphibian crisis being a few broader examples of an almost universal, cosmopolitan
decline in biodiversity. Human overpopulation ( continued population growth) along with profligate
consumption are considered to be  primary drivers of this rapid decline.[93][94]  2017 World
Scientists' Warning to Humanity stated that, among or things, this sixth extinction event unleashed by
humanity could annihilate many current life forms  consign m to extinction by  end of this
century.[26]


Decline in biodiversity                                  High-level political attention on  environment has been
                                                         focused largely on climate change because energy policy
Defaunation is  loss of animals from ecological       is central to economic growth. But biodiversity is just as

communities.[96]

It is estimated that more than 50 percent of all         —Robert Watson, 2019.[95]
wildlife has been lost in  last 40 years.[97] It is
estimated that by 2020, 68% of  world's
wildlife will be lost.[98] In South America, re is believed to be a 70 percent loss.[99] A May 2018 study
published in PNAS found that 83% of wild mammals, 80% of marine mammals, 50% of plants  15% of
fish have been lost since  dawn of human civilization. Currently, livestock make up 60% of  biomass
of all mammals on earth, followed by humans (36%)  wild mammals (4%).[31] According to  2019
global biodiversity assessment by IPBES, human civilization has pushed one million species of plants 
animals to  brink of extinction, with many of se projected to vanish over  next few
decades.[100][101][102]

Whenever re is a decline in plant biodiversity,  remaining plants start to experience diminishing
productivity. As a result,  loss of biodiversity continues being a threat to  productivity of 
ecosystem all over  world,  this over ally impacts  natural ecosystem functioning. [103]

A 2019 report that assessed a total of 28,000 plant species concluded that close to half of m were facing a
threat of extinction.  failure of noticing  appreciating plants is regarded as "plant blindness",  this
is a worrying trend as it puts more plants at  threat of extinction than animals. Our increased farming has
come at a higher cost to plant biodiversity as half of  habitable l on Earth is used for agriculture, 
this is one of  major reasons behind  plant extinction crisis.[104]


Invasive species

Introductions of species, particularly plants into new areas, by whatever means  for whatever reasons
have brought about major  permanent changes to  environment over large areas. Examples include 
introduction of Caulerpa taxifolia into  Mediterranean,  introduction of oat species into  California
grassls,   introduction of privet, kudzu,  purple loosestrife to North America. Rats, cats, 
goats have radically altered biodiversity in many isls. Additionally, introductions have resulted in genetic
changes to native fauna where interbreeding has taken place, as with buffalo with domestic cattle, 
wolves with domestic dogs.


Death of coral reefs

Because of human overpopulation, coral reefs are dying around 
world.[105] In particular, coral mining, pollution (organic  non-
organic), overfishing, blast fishing   digging of canals 
access into isls  bays are serious threats to se ecosystems.
Coral reefs also face high dangers from pollution, diseases,
destructive fishing practices  warming oceans.[106] In order to
find answers for se problems, researchers study  various
factors that impact reefs.  list of factors is long, including 
ocean's role as a carbon dioxide sink, atmospheric changes,
                                                                            A major coral bleaching event took
ultraviolet light, ocean acidification, biological virus, impacts of dust
                                                                            place on this part of  Great Barrier

 ors. Reefs are threatened well beyond coastal areas.

General estimates show approximately 10% world's coral reefs are
already dead.[107][108][109] It is estimated that about 60% of  world's reefs are at risk due to destructive,
human-related activities.  threat to  health of reefs is particularly strong in Souast Asia, where 80%
of reefs are endangered.


Pollution by wastewater

Domestic, industrial  agricultural wastewater makes its way to wastewater plants for treatment before
being released into aquatic ecosystems. Wastewater at se treatment plants contains a cocktail of different
chemical  biological contaminants which may influence surrounding ecosystems. For example, 
nutrient rich water supports large populations of pollutant-tolerant Chironomidae, which in-turn attract
insectivorous bats.[110] se insects accumulate toxins in ir exoskeletons  pass m on to
insectivorous birds  bats. As a result, metals may accumulate in  tissues  organs of se
animals,[111] resulting in DNA damage,[110]  histopathological lesions.[112] Furrmore, this altered diet
of fat-rich prey may cause changes in energy storage[113]  hormone production,[114] which may have
significant impacts on torpor, reproduction, metabolism  survival.

Biological contaminants such as bacteria, viruses  fungi in wastewater can also be transferred to 
surrounding ecosystem. Insects emerging from this wastewater may spread pathogens to nearby water
sources. Pathogens, shed from humans, can be passed from this wastewater to organisms foraging at se
treatment plants. This may lead to bacterial  viral infections or microbiome dysbiosis.


Climate change impacts
Global warming is  result of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations which is caused
primarily by  combustion of fossil energy sources such as petroleum, coal,  natural gas,  to an
unknown extent by destruction of forests, increased methane, volcanic activity  cement production. Such
massive alteration of  global carbon cycle has only been possible because of  availability 
deployment of advanced technologies, ranging in application from fossil fuel exploration, extraction,
distribution, refining,  combustion in power plants  automobile engines  advanced farming
practices. Livestock contributes to climate change both through  production of greenhouse gases 
through destruction of carbon sinks such as rain-forests. According
to  2006 United Nations/FAO report, 18% of all greenhouse gas
emissions found in  atmosphere are due to livestock.  raising
of livestock   l needed to feed m has resulted in 
destruction of millions of acres of rainforest  as global dem
for meat rises, so too will  dem for l. Ninety-one percent
of all rainforest l deforested since 1970 is now used for
livestock.[115] Potential negative environmental impacts caused by
increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are rising
                                                                         September 2019 climate strike in
global air temperatures, altered hydrogeological cycles resulting in     Alice Springs, Australia
more frequent  severe droughts, storms,  floods, as well as sea
level rise  ecosystem disruption.[116]


Acid Deposition

 fossils that are burned by humans for energy usually come back to m in  form of acid rain. Acid
rain is a form of precipitation which has high sulfuric  nitric acids which can occur in  form of a fog
or snow. Acid rain has numerous ecological impacts on streams, lakes, wetls  or aquatic
environments. It damages forests, robs  soil of its essential nutrients, releases aluminium to  soil,
which makes it very hard for trees to absorb water.[117]

Researchers have discovered that kelp, eelgrass  or vegetation can effectively absorb carbon dioxide
 hence reducing ocean acidity. Scientists, refore, say that growing se plants could help in
mitigating  damaging effects of acidification on marine life.[118]


Ozone depletion on Vegetation

Ozone depletion damages plants all over  world  this includes both  plants in  natural
ecosystems   agricultural crops. It damages vegetation by entering through  leaf’s stomata 
burning that plant tissue during  respiration process.[119] Ground-level ozone is known for causing more
plant damage than any or all  combination of all or air pollutants.

Reduced ozone levels due to ozone depletion indicate that re is less protection from sun rays  more
exposure to UVB radiation at  surface of  Earth. UVB radiation affects  developmental 
physiological processes of plants. se effects include changes in plant form,  timing of developmental
phases, distribution of nutrients within  plant  secondary metabolism.[120]


Disruption of  nitrogen cycle

Of particular concern is N2O, which has an average atmospheric lifetime of 114–120 years,[121]  is 300
times more effective than CO2 as a greenhouse gas.[122] NOx produced by industrial processes, automobiles
 agricultural fertilization  NH3 emitted from soils (i.e., as an additional byproduct of
nitrification)[122]  livestock operations are transported to downwind ecosystems, influencing N cycling
 nutrient losses. Six major effects of NOx  NH3 emissions have been identified:[123]

 1.   decreased atmospheric visibility due to ammonium aerosols (fine particulate matter [PM])
 2.   elevated ozone concentrations
 3.   ozone  PM affects human health (e.g. respiratory diseases, cancer)
 4.   increases in radiative forcing  global warming
 5. decreased agricultural productivity due to ozone deposition
 6. ecosystem acidification[124]  eutrophication.


Technology impacts
 applications of technology often result in unavoidable  unexpected environmental impacts, which
according to  I = PAT equation is measured as resource use or pollution generated per unit GDP.
Environmental impacts caused by  application of technology are often perceived as unavoidable for
several reasons. First, given that  purpose of many technologies is to exploit, control, or orwise
“improve” upon nature for  perceived benefit of humanity while at  same time  myriad of processes
in nature have been optimized  are continually adjusted by evolution, any disturbance of se natural
processes by technology is likely to result in negative environmental consequences.[125] Second, 
conservation of mass principle   first law of rmodynamics (i.e., conservation of energy) dictate that
whenever material resources or energy are moved around or manipulated by technology, environmental
consequences are inescapable. Third, according to  second law of rmodynamics, order can be
increased within a system (such as  human economy) only by increasing disorder or entropy outside 
system (i.e.,  environment). Thus, technologies can create “order” in  human economy (i.e., order as
manifested in buildings, factories, transportation networks, communication systems, etc.) only at 
expense of increasing “disorder” in  environment. According to a number of studies, increased entropy is
likely to be correlated to negative environmental impacts.[126][127][128][129]

Mining industry
 environmental impact of mining includes erosion, formation of
sinkholes, loss of biodiversity,  contamination of soil,
groundwater  surface water by chemicals from mining processes.
In some cases, additional forest logging is done in  vicinity of
mines to increase  available room for  storage of  created
debris  soil.[130]

Even though plants need some heavy metals for ir growth, excess
of se metals is usually toxic to m. Plants that are polluted with
heavy metals usually depict reduced growth, yield  performance.        Acid mine drainage in  Rio Tinto
Pollution by heavy metals decreases  soil organic matter               River
composition resulting in a decline in soil nutrients which n leads
to a decline in  growth of plants or even death.[131]

Besides creating environmental damage,  contamination resulting from leakage of chemicals also affect
 health of  local population.[132] Mining companies in some countries are required to follow
environmental  rehabilitation codes, ensuring  area mined is returned to close to its original state.
Some mining methods may have significant environmental  public health effects. Heavy metals usually
exhibit toxic effects towards  soil biota,  this is through  affection of  microbial processes 
decreases  number as well as activity of soil microorganisms. Low concentration of heavy metals also has
high chances of inhibiting  plant's physiological metabolism. [133]

Energy industry
 environmental impact of energy harvesting  consumption is diverse. In recent years re has been a
trend towards  increased commercialization of various renewable energy sources.
In  real world, consumption of fossil fuel resources leads to global warming  climate change.
However, little change is being made in many parts of  world. If  peak oil ory proves true, more
explorations of viable alternative energy sources, could be more friendly to  environment.

Rapidly advancing technologies can achieve a transition of energy generation, water  waste management,
 food production towards better environmental  energy usage practices using methods of systems
ecology  industrial ecology.[134][135]


Biodiesel

 environmental impact of biodiesel includes energy use, greenhouse gas emissions  some or kinds
of pollution. A joint life cycle analysis by  US Department of Agriculture   US Department of
Energy found that substituting 100% biodiesel for petroleum diesel in buses reduced life cycle consumption
of petroleum by 95%. Biodiesel reduced net emissions of carbon dioxide by 78.45%, compared with
petroleum diesel. In urban buses, biodiesel reduced particulate emissions 32 percent, carbon monoxide
emissions 35 percent,  emissions of sulfur oxides 8%, relative to life cycle emissions associated with use
of petroleum diesel. Life cycle emissions of hydrocarbons were 35% higher  emission of various
nitrogen oxides (NOx) were 13.5% higher with biodiesel.[136] Life cycle analyses by  Argonne National
Laboratory have indicated reduced fossil energy use  reduced greenhouse gas emissions with biodiesel,
compared with petroleum diesel use.[137] Biodiesel derived from various vegetable oils (e.g. canola or
soybean oil), is readily biodegradable in  environment compared with petroleum diesel.[138]


Coal mining  burning

 environmental impact of coal mining  -burning is
diverse.[139] Legislation passed by  US Congress in 1990 required
 United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue a
plan to alleviate toxic air pollution from coal-fired power plants.
After delay  litigation,  EPA now has a court-imposed
deadline of March 16, 2011, to issue its report.
                                                                         Smog in Beijing, China

Electricity generation

 environmental impact of electricity generation is significant because modern society uses large amounts
of electrical power. This power is normally generated at power plants that convert some or kind of energy
into electricity. Each such system has advantages  disadvantages, but many of m pose environmental
concerns.


Nuclear power

 environmental impact of nuclear power results from  nuclear fuel cycle processes including mining,
processing, transporting  storing fuel  radioactive fuel waste. Released radioisotopes pose a health
danger to human populations, animals  plants as radioactive particles enter organisms through various
transmission routes.

Radiation is a carcinogen  causes numerous effects on living organisms  systems.  environmental
impacts of nuclear power plant disasters such as  Chernobyl disaster,  Fukushima Daiichi nuclear
disaster   Three Mile Isl accident, among ors, persist indefinitely, though several or factors
contributed to se events including improper management of fail safe systems  natural disasters putting
uncommon stress on  generators.  radioactive decay rate of
particles varies greatly, dependent upon  nuclear properties of a
particular isotope. Radioactive Plutonium-244 has a half-life of 80.8
million years, which indicates  time duration required for half of a
given sample to decay, though very little plutonium-244 is produced
in  nuclear fuel cycle  lower half-life materials have lower
activity thus giving off less dangerous radiation.[140]


Oil shale industry
                                                                          Anti-nuclear protest near nuclear
                                                                          waste disposal centre at Gorleben in
 environmental impact of  oil shale industry includes 
                                                                          norrn Germany
consideration of issues such as l use, waste management, water
 air pollution caused by  extraction  processing of oil
shale. Surface mining of oil shale deposits causes  usual
environmental impacts of open-pit mining. In addition, 
combustion  rmal processing generate waste material, which
must be disposed of,  harmful atmospheric emissions, including
carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. Experimental in-situ
conversion processes  carbon capture  storage technologies
may reduce some of se concerns in future, but may raise ors,
such as  pollution of groundwater.[141]
                                                                          Kiviõli Oil Shale Processing &
                                                                          Chemicals Plant in ida-Virumaa,
Petroleum                                                                 Estonia

 environmental impact of petroleum is often negative because it
is toxic to almost all forms of life. Petroleum, a common word for oil or natural gas, is closely linked to
virtually all aspects of present society, especially for transportation  heating for both homes  for
commercial activities.


Reservoirs

 environmental impact of reservoirs is coming under ever
increasing scrutiny as  world dem for water  energy
increases   number  size of reservoirs increases.

Dams   reservoirs can be used to supply drinking water,
generate hydroelectric power, increasing  water supply for
irrigation, provide recreational opportunities  flood control.
However, adverse environmental  sociological impacts have also
been identified during  after many reservoir constructions.
Although  impact varies greatly between different dams              Wachusett Dam in Clinton,
reservoirs, common criticisms include preventing sea-run fish from       Massachusetts
reaching ir historical mating grounds, less access to water
downstream,  a smaller catch for fishing communities in  area.
Advances in technology have provided solutions to many negative impacts of dams but se advances are
often not viewed as worth investing in if not required by law or under  threat of fines. Wher reservoir
projects are ultimately beneficial or detrimental—to both  environment  surrounding human
populations— has been debated since  1960s  probably long before that. In 1960  construction of
Llyn Celyn   flooding of Capel Celyn provoked political uproar which continues to this day. More
recently,  construction of Three Gorges Dam  or similar projects throughout Asia, Africa  Latin
America have generated considerable environmental  political debate.


Wind power

Compared to  environmental impact of traditional energy sources,
 environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor. Wind
powered electricity generation consumes no fuel,  emits no air
pollution, unlike fossil fuel power sources.  energy consumed to
manufacture  transport  materials used to build a wind power
plant is equal to  new energy produced by  plant within a few
months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of l, many
l uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas
of turbine foundations  infrastructure made unavailable for
                                                                           Wind turbines in an agricultural
use.[142]
                                                                           setting
re are reports of bird  bat mortality at wind turbines, as re
are around or artificial structures.  scale of  ecological
impact may[143] or may not[144] be significant, depending on specific circumstances. Prevention 
mitigation of wildlife fatalities,  protection of peat bogs,[145] affect  siting  operation of wind
turbines.

re are conflicting reports about  effects of noise on people who live very close to a wind turbine.

Manufacturing

Cleaning agents

 environmental impact of cleaning agents is diverse. In recent
years, measures have been taken to reduce se effects.


Nanotechnology
                                                                           Waste generation, measured in
Nanotechnology's environmental impact can be split into two                kilograms per person per day
aspects:  potential for nanotechnological innovations to help
improve  environment,   possibly novel type of pollution
that nanotechnological materials might cause if released into  environment. As nanotechnology is an
emerging field, re is great debate regarding to what extent industrial  commercial use of
nanomaterials will affect organisms  ecosystems.


Paint

 environmental impact of paint is diverse. Traditional painting materials  processes can have harmful
effects on  environment, including those from  use of lead  or additives. Measures can be taken
to reduce environmental impact, including accurately estimating paint quantities so that wastage is
minimized, use of paints, coatings, painting accessories  techniques that are environmentally preferred.
 United States Environmental Protection Agency guidelines  Green Star ratings are some of 
stards that can be applied.


Paper

 environmental impact of paper is significant, which has led to
changes in industry  behaviour at both business  personal
levels. With  use of modern technology such as  printing press
  highly mechanised harvesting of wood, paper has become a
cheap commodity. This has led to a high level of consumption 
waste. With  rise in environmental awareness due to  lobbying
by environmental organizations  with increased government
regulation re is now a trend towards sustainability in  pulp 
paper industry.
                                                                            A pulp  paper mill in New
                                                                            Brunswick, Canada. Although pulp
Plastics                                                                     paper manufacturing requires
                                                                            large amounts of energy, a portion of
                                                                            it comes from burning wood waste.
Some scientists suggest that by 2050 re could be more plastic
than fish in  oceans.[146]


Pesticides

 environmental impact of pesticides is often greater than what is
intended by those who use m. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides
 95% of herbicides reach a destination or than ir target
species, including nontarget species, air, water, bottom sediments,
 food.[147] Pesticide contaminates l  water when it escapes        Great Pacific garbage patch
from production sites  storage tanks, when it runs off from fields,
when it is discarded, when it is sprayed aerially,  when it is
sprayed into water to kill algae.[148]

 amount of pesticide that migrates from  intended application area is influenced by  particular
chemical's properties: its propensity for binding to soil, its vapor pressure, its water solubility,  its
resistance to being broken down over time.[149] Factors in  soil, such as its texture, its ability to retain
water,   amount of organic matter contained in it, also affect  amount of pesticide that will leave 
area.[149] Some pesticides contribute to global warming   depletion of  ozone layer.[150]


Pharmaceuticals

 environmental impact of pharmaceuticals  personal care products (PPCPs) is largely speculative.
PPCPs are substances used by individuals for personal health or cosmetic reasons   products used by
agribusiness to boost growth or health of livestock. PPCPs have been detected in water bodies throughout
 world.  effects of se chemicals on humans   environment are not yet known, but to date
re is no scientific evidence that y affect human health.[151]


Transport
 environmental impact of transport is significant because it is a
major user of energy,  burns most of  world's petroleum. This
creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides  particulates,  is
a significant contributor to global warming through emission of
carbon dioxide,[152] for which transport is  fastest-growing
emission sector.[153] By subsector, road transport is  largest
contributor to global warming.[152]

Environmental regulations in developed countries have reduced 
individual vehicles emission; however, this has been offset by an           Interstate 10  Interstate 45 near
increase in  number of vehicles,  more use of each                    downtown Houston, Texas in 
vehicle.[152] Some pathways to reduce  carbon emissions of road          United States
vehicles considerably have been studied.[154] Energy use 
emissions vary largely between modes, causing environmentalists to
call for a transition from air  road to rail  human-powered            transport,  increase transport
electrification  energy efficiency.

Or environmental impacts of transport systems include traffic congestion  automobile-oriented urban
sprawl, which can consume natural habitat  agricultural ls. By reducing transportation emissions
globally, it is predicted that re will be significant positive effects on Earth's air quality, acid rain, smog
 climate change.[155]

 health impact of transport emissions is also of concern. A recent survey of  studies on  effect of
traffic emissions on pregnancy outcomes has linked exposure to emissions to adverse effects on gestational
duration  possibly also intrauterine growth.[156]


Aviation

 environmental impact of aviation occurs because aircraft engines emit noise, particulates,  gases
which contribute to climate change[157][158]  global dimming.[159] Despite emission reductions from
automobiles  more fuel-efficient  less polluting turbofan  turboprop engines,  rapid growth of
air travel in recent years contributes to an increase in total pollution attributable to aviation. In  EU,
greenhouse gas emissions from aviation increased by 87% between 1990  2006.[160] Among or
factors leading to this phenomenon are  increasing number of hypermobile travellers[161]  social
factors that are making air travel commonplace, such as frequent flyer programs.[161]

re is an ongoing debate about possible taxation of air travel   inclusion of aviation in an emissions
trading scheme, with a view to ensuring that  total external costs of aviation are taken into account.[162]


Roads

 environmental impact of roads includes  local effects of highways (public roads) such as on noise,
light pollution, water pollution, habitat destruction/disturbance  local air quality;   wider effects
including climate change from vehicle emissions.  design, construction  management of roads,
parking  or related facilities as well as  design  regulation of vehicles can change  impacts to
varying degrees.


Shipping
 environmental impact of shipping includes greenhouse gas emissions  oil pollution. In 2007, carbon
dioxide emissions from shipping were estimated at 4 to 5% of  global total,  estimated by 
International Maritime Organization (IMO) to rise by up to 72% by 2020 if no action is taken.[163] re is
also a potential for introducing invasive species into new areas through shipping, usually by attaching
mselves to  ship's hull.

 First Intersessional Meeting of  IMO Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions[164] from Ships
took place in Oslo, Norway on 23–27 June 2008. It was tasked with developing  technical basis for 
reduction mechanisms that may form part of a future IMO regime to control greenhouse gas emissions from
international shipping,  a draft of  actual reduction mechanisms mselves, for furr consideration
by IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC).[165]


Military
General military spending  military activities have marked
environmental effects.[166]  United States military is considered
one of  worst polluters in  world, responsible for over 39,000
sites contaminated with hazardous materials.[167] Several studies
have also found a strong positive correlation between higher military
spending  higher carbon emissions where increased military
spending has a larger effect on increasing carbon emissions in 
Global North than in  Global South.[168][166] Military activities
also affect l use  are extremely resource-intensive.[169]          An Agent Orange spray run by
                                                                         aircraft, part of Operation Ranch
 military does not solely have negative effects on                 H, during  Vietnam War
environment.[170] re are several examples of militaries aiding in
l management, conservation,  greening of an area.[171]
Additionally, certain military technologies have proven extremely helpful for conservationists 
environmental scientists.[172]

As well as  cost to human life  society, re is a significant environmental impact of war. Scorched
earth methods during, or after war have been in use for much of recorded history but with modern
technology war can cause a far greater devastation on  environment. Unexploded ordnance can render
l unusable for furr use or make access across it dangerous or fatal.[173]


Light pollution
Artificial light at night is one of  most obvious physical changes
that humans have made to  biosphere,  is  easiest form of
pollution to observe from space.[174]  main environmental
impacts of artificial light are due to light's use as an information
source (rar than an energy source).  hunting efficiency of
visual predators generally increases under artificial light, changing
predator prey interactions. Artificial light also affects dispersal,
orientation, migration,  hormone levels, resulting in disrupted
circadian rhythms.[175]
                                                                         A composite image of artificial light
                                                                         emissions from Earth at night

    as  primary causative factor of or ecologically destructive phenomena. Current human
    disease epidemics are explored as a function of population size. That human population
    growth is itself a phenomenon with clearly identifiable ecological/biological causes has been
    overlooked. Here, human population growth is discussed as being subject to  same
    dynamic processes as  population growth of or species. Contrary to  widely held
    belief that food production must be increased to feed  growing population, experimental 
    correlational data indicate that human population growth varies as a function of food
    availability. By increasing food production for humans, at  expense of or species, 
    biologically determined effect has been,  continues to be, an increase in  human
    population. Understing  relationship between food increases  population increases
    is proposed as a necessary first step in addressing this global problem. Resistance to this
    perspective is briefly discussed in terms of cultural bias in science."
